# Coursera Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The objective of the class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning) was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an summary analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

Note: Before running the R Script, you must first replace the existing file path used for this specific analysis with your own chosen project folder path name that contains your R Script.  Once this has been changed, the R Script will then create a sub-folder called "Project" to "house" the data files that are then downloaded and unzipped.

Once the steps above are completed, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R).

The output of the R script is a tidy data set in tab-delimited form, called "tidyagg.txt".
You can read more about the data and the analysis in the code book.
